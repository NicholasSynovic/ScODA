## Abstract

Supercomputers are powerful, complicated, and exepensive national resources.
These devices enable researchers to answer basic science research questions
through computational modeling, training of foundational scientific deep
learning models, and prediction of natural phenomenon. However, these devices
are prone to failure, consume significant power and cooling resources, and
undergo varying levels of computational load. Thus the system logs, environment
sensors, and other monitoring utilities are captured in stored in distributed,
parallel databases and lakehouses.

This data enables business intelligence, operations, and high-performance
computing (HPC) research teams to access, query, and evaluate the data for
different tasks. But as supercomputers scale towards post-exascale computation,
the amount of processing power to host, query, and load data into these
databases concurrently and in real-time also grows. Thus, *ScODA* was created as
a pipeline to evaluate different database and lakehouse solutions on real and
synthetic environmental data from supercomputing facilities.
